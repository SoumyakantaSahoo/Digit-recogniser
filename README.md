This notebook aims at implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the Keras and TensorFlow to implement a digit recognising program.

I have used the MNIST dataset that is present in tensorflow.keras.datasets. Additional dependencies include matplotlib and numpy.

The code in this notebook is being used only for educational purposes.
